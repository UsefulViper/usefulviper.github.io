# AI-Powered Image Gallery

A modern web application that uses artificial intelligence to analyze and categorize your images. Upload photos and watch as machine learning models detect objects, classify content, and extract dominant colors to organize your visual content intelligently.

## Features

- **Image Analysis**: Uses TensorFlow.js with MobileNet and COCO-SSD models to analyze images directly in the browser
- **Object Detection**: Identifies and highlights objects in your images with bounding boxes
- **Image Classification**: Categorizes images into primary categories like people, animals, food, nature, and architecture
- **Color Analysis**: Extracts dominant colors from images for visual filtering
- **Search Functionality**: Search by detected content, objects, or categories
- **Filter System**: Filter by category, color, and other attributes
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
- **Dark/Light Theme**: Toggle between dark and light modes based on your preference

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES6+)
- **AI Models**: TensorFlow.js, MobileNet, COCO-SSD
- **UI Components**: Custom CSS with responsive design principles
- **Icons**: Font Awesome

## How It Works

1. **Upload Images**: Drag and drop or select files from your device
2. **AI Processing**: Browser-based AI models analyze the images without sending data to external servers
3. **View Results**: Browse through your analyzed images with AI metadata
4. **Search & Filter**: Find specific content or visually similar images
5. **Inspect Details**: View detailed AI predictions and detected objects

## Getting Started

Simply open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser to get started. No server setup is required as all AI processing happens directly in your browser.

### Notes

- First-time use may require downloading AI models (approximately 20MB total)
- Processing time depends on your device's capabilities and the image size
- For best performance, use Chrome, Firefox, or Edge browsers

## Privacy

Since all processing happens locally in your browser, your images are never uploaded to any server. This ensures complete privacy of your visual content while still benefiting from advanced AI features.

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome (recommended): Version 90+
- Firefox: Version 90+
- Safari: Version 14+
- Edge: Version 90+
